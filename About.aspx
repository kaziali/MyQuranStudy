        <h3>About</h3>

        Assalamu alaikum, my name is Kazi Nasrat Ali, living in Washington state of USA.   
        Alhamdulillah, with the help of Allah I am able to build this website for those who want 
        to strive in the path of knowledge of the Magnificent Quran.
        With this website, you can study the Quran word-for-word. 
        This site can help you learn and memorize the meaning of each Arabic word in the Quran.
        <p></p>
        You can track your progress as you continue your efforts in learning the meanings. 
        For every word you will find its root word, and Lane's Lexicon reference links for them.
        Registration is free.<p></p>
        <%-- I have collected data from many sites like, corpus.quran.com, tanzil.info 
         and new.everyayah.com - May Allah reward these site administratots.--%>
         
        Quran being the words of Allah, a Muslim must have strong connection 
        with Quran. He should try his best to understand the Quran and know the meaning of the verses.
        Special thanks to corpus.quran.com, tanzil.info, new.everyayah.com for data files - May Allah reward these site owners.
